    make defines for left and right motors

    # ignoring return values and parameters to pass in because I don't know
    # what these funcions would need yet, these ideas are not fleshed out

    motor_init() - initialize the motors to stop
    ss_motor() - flip bit to start or stop motors 
    spin() - set motors for bot to spin
    forward() - make robot move forward. could make it so you can control speed
    reverse() - same idea as above backwards
    
    turn()
    u-turn()
    # maybe the above two could be combined. mabe there would be a smart way to
    # figure out what angle turn you would like to make and could implement that

    # honestly may not end up using these functions, but it might be a good exercise?
    # maybe it will make work down the line easier?
