Run powershell in admin mode

//Powrshell - list the connected devices
usbipd wsl list

//Powrshell - attach device to WSL
usbipd wsl attach --busid <busid> 

//Powershell - detach device from WSL
usbipd wsl detach --busid <busid>

//Ubuntu - list USB connections

/*
//You can also look in the dev folder to find the device and use that
//identifier in make when building a program and flashing the bumblebee board.
//I have found it to be ttyACM0.
*/

//shorthand to check if it is connected and under dev folder
ls /dev/ttyACM0

//also you need permissions to use the device so either run make with sudo or
//change device permissions
sudo chmod +777 /dev/ttyACM0

//Then you should be ready to make the program and flash the device!
make 
make program_linux

//I have looked up an article to make the usb permissions permanent
//https://www.xmodulo.com/change-usb-device-permission-linux.html

//--Instructions--//
//you need to identify the vendorID and productID of your USB device. For that, use lsusb command.
lsusb -vvv

    On Nathans computer:
        idVendor           0x04b4 Cypress Semiconductor Corp.
        idProduct          0x0003

//Next, create a new udev rule as follows. Once in file, add new rule
sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/50-myusb.rules
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="<#>", ATTRS{idProduct}=="<#>", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"

//Now reboot your machine or reload udev rules
sudo udevadm control --reload // having trouble here

//Then verify the permission of the USB device. (make sure youre in /dev and can see device)
