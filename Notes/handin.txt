/*
Directions:

    0. Upload files to cal poly servers using ssh, putty, ftp, whatever. 
        (I am using filezilla, haven't figure out how to do otherwise.)
        
        or use SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)
        scp [file_name]  remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/directory
        scp ./<lab_folder>/<lab> njaggers@unix2.csc.calpoly.edu:~/CPE416/<lab_folder>

    1. Open Terminal 

    2. SHH to Cal poly server (use calpoly password)
        ssh <username>@unix1.csc.calpoly.edu 
        ssh njaggers@unix1.csc.calpoly.edu
        ssh wkeitz@unix1.csc.calpoly.edu

        Note: If you're at calpoly, using the VPN might cause issues.
              If unix1 is slow you can try 1-5.

    3. Handin files
        handin <toAccount> <assignmentName> <file>
            toAccount: is the name of the instructor's account.
            assignmentName: is the official assignment name given to you by the instructor.
            file: is the name of the file in the current directory you want to submit.

            handin jseng CPE416_lab1 filename.c

        handin <toAccount> <assignmentName>
            using this format will show what you have already turned in.
